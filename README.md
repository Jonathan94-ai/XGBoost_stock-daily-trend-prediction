# XGBoost_stock-daily-trend-prediction

I built an XGBoost classifier to predict daily Open price direction of a stock.

- In the xgboost_daily_trend_prediction.py file I prepare the data, train it, test it and draw the features importance curve and the AUC ROC curve. 

- AAPL.csv is the stock's data.

Have fun !
